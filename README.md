# Activism Mailbot

In light of recent events, I have created this Python script to send emails to a list of 542 elected US officials.

The script sends a **unique message to each lawmaker** by varying sentence structures and switching out nouns, verbs, adverbs, and adjectives with synonyms. Each email is constructed to roughly follow the template from [nomoreracistcops.github.io](https://nomoreracistcops.github.io/). Please report bugs to alandgton@gmail.com!

**This script only works for gmail accounts.** 

NOTE: there is a per-minute limit on SMTP messages sent via google's servers. to appease our corporate overlords, i've decreased the speed of our operations.

If you're going to use this tool in one of your projects, I'm hoping that you'll have enough self-respect to give credit where it is due. **Please do not monetize this script.** Thanks!!

## Setup
1. Download the source code
	- Option 1: click the green "Clone or download" button on the upper-right, then "Download ZIP"
		- Then, decompress the files somewhere on your computer
	- Option 2: `git clone https://github.com/alandgton/activism-mail-bot.git`
		- Requires: a Github account, a terminal, and git installation

2. Temporarily grant mailbot permission to send emails on your behalf
	- Turn [_Allow less secure apps_  to  _ON_](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps) for your gmail account.
		- Be aware that this makes it easier for others to gain access to your account.
		- After running the script, you should switch this back OFF.
		- Your name, gmail, and password aren't being stored on a server anywhere, this script is run from your own computer!
	- If you have 2 Factor Authentication enabled on your gmail account:
		- [Follow these instructions](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833)
	

## Running the script
- Option 1: Use Docker (**RECOMMENDED**)
	- Shoutout to [darrylbalderas](https://github.com/darrylbalderas) for setting this up!
	- Install docker-engine
    	- [Mac or Windows](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (Catalina, Mojave, or High Sierra; Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, or Education)
    	    - For older Mac and Windows systems install [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/)
   		- [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)

	- Run the command: `./exec-docker`
		- Make sure you're in the `activism-mailbot/` or `activism-mailbot-master/` directory
			- Use `cd activism-mailbot/` or `cd ~/activism-mailbot/` or `cd /path/to/activism-mailbot/`
		- If that doesn't work, then execute the following sequence of commands:
			- `docker build -t activism-mailbot .`
			- Might need to remove the old container: `docker rm -f activism-mailbot`
			- `docker run --name activism-mailbot -d activism-mailbot`
			- `docker exec -it $(docker ps -aqf "name=activism-mailbot") /bin/bash`

	- Run application: `python send.py`
	
- Option 2: Legacy Method
	- [Install python3](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)
	- Mac Users: you can double-click the `install-osx-python3` file instead
	- Windows Users: TBD

	- Mac Users: you may need to install certificates for SSL to work
		- âŒ˜ + space, search for a file named "Install Certificates.command"
		- double-click the resulting file
		- [Read more here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52805115/certificate-verify-failed-unable-to-get-local-issuer-certificate)

	- Run `python3 send.py`
		- Make sure you are in the `activism-mail-bot` directory
		- If you aren't, use the command `cd activism-mail-bot/`
		
## How to use mailbot
