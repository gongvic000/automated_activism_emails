# Activism Emails

In light the of China's treatment towards Uyghur Muslim, it is imperative that we push more more than a dimplomatic boycott, but a postponement, relocation or athlete boycott. 

The script sends a **unique message to each lawmaker** by varying sentence structures and switching out nouns, verbs, adverbs, and adjectives with synonyms. 

**This script only works for gmail accounts.** 

NOTE: there is a per-minute limit on SMTP messages sent via google's servers. to appease our corporate overlords, i've decreased the speed of our operations.

	- Option 1: click the green "Clone or download" button on the upper-right, then "Download ZIP"
		- Then, decompress the files somewhere on your computer
	- Option 2: `git clone https://github.com/alandgton/activism-mail-bot.git`

2. Temporarily grant mailbot permission to send emails on your behalf
	- Turn [_Allow less secure apps_  to  _ON_](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps) for your gmail account.
